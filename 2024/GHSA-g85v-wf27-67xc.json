	"summary": "Harden-Runner has a command injection weaknesses in `setup.ts` and `arc-runner.ts`",
	"details": "### Summary\n\nVersions of step-security/harden-runner prior to v2.10.2 contain multiple command injection weaknesses via environment variables that could potentially be exploited under specific conditions. However, due to the current execution order of pre-steps in GitHub Actions and the placement of harden-runner as the first step in a job, the likelihood of exploitation is low as the Harden-Runner action reads the environment variable during the pre-step stage. There are no known exploits at this time. \n\n### Details\n\n1. setup.ts:169 [1]  performs `execSync` with a command that gets\ninvoked after interpretation by the shell. This command includes an\ninterpolated `process.env.USER` variable, which an attacker could\nmodify (without actually creating a new user) to inject arbitrary\nshell expressions into this `execSync`. This may or may not be likely\nin practice, but I believe the hygienic way to perform the underlying\noperation is to use `execFileSync` or similar and bypass the\nunderlying shell evaluation.\n\n2. setup.ts:229 [2] has a nearly identical `execSync` to (1) above,\nbut with `$USER` for shell-level interpolation rather than string\ninterpolation. However, this is still injectable and would be best\nreplaced by an `execFileSync`, per above.\n\n3. arc-runner:40-44 [3] has an `execSync` with multiple string\ninterpolations. Most of these do not appear immediately injectible\n(since they appear to come from presumed trusted API responses), but\nthe expansion of `getRunnerTempDir()` may be injectable due to its\ndependence on potentially attacker-controllable environment variables\n(e.g. `RUNNER_TEMP`). The underlying operation appears to be a trivial\nfile copy, so this entire subprocess should in theory be replaceable\nwith ordinary NodeJS `fs` API calls instead.\n\n4. arc-runner:53 [4] demonstrates the same weakness, and has the same\nresolution as (3).\n\n5. arc-runner:57 demonstrates the same weakness as (3) and (4), and\nhas the same resolution.\n\n6. arc-runner:61 demonstrates the same weakness as (3), (4), and (5),\nand has the same resolution.\n\n\n[1]: https://github.com/step-security/harden-runner/blob/951b48540b429070694bc8abd82fd6901eb123ca/src/setup.ts#L169\n\n[2]: https://github.com/step-security/harden-runner/blob/951b48540b429070694bc8abd82fd6901eb123ca/src/setup.ts#L229\n\n[3]: https://github.com/step-security/harden-runner/blob/951b48540b429070694bc8abd82fd6901eb123ca/src/arc-runner.ts#L40-L44\n\n[4]: https://github.com/step-security/harden-runner/blob/951b48540b429070694bc8abd82fd6901eb123ca/src/arc-runner.ts#L53\n\n[5]: https://github.com/step-security/harden-runner/blob/951b48540b429070694bc8abd82fd6901eb123ca/src/arc-runner.ts#L57\n\n[6]: https://github.com/step-security/harden-runner/blob/951b48540b429070694bc8abd82fd6901eb123ca/src/arc-runner.ts#L61",
